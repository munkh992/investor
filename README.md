[](javascript:;)\n# Architecture\n27 May 2024 | \n[Feedback](javascript:;)\nThis section details the architectural design of EDS, which includes the functional, technical and deployment architecture for both on-premise and Azure cloud.\n## Functional Architecture\nThe following figure shows the functional architecture of EDS and its data extraction process.\n![EDS Functional Architecture](https://docs.temenos.com/docs/Solutions/Analytics/Data_Lake_for_Transact/Extract_Data_Store/Resources/Images/Extract%20Data%20Store/Functional_architecture.1.png)\nData extraction from EDS takes place through the following steps.\n  1. Transact releases data through commit capture as data events. It happens in two ways:\n     * Initial Load Process – to push all the existing legacy data as data events through Initial Load service (RR.INITIAL.LOAD.SERVICE).\n     * Streaming data – to push every transaction that happens in Transact system as data event.\n  2. Enterprise Streaming consumes events from the data event table and those persisted in Kafka or AEH, in Avro format.\n  3. Once events reach the topic, Temenos Data Engineering landing process (Enterprise Streaming landing process) consumes the events and transforms to Delta Lake format in landing data store (insert only) tables throughout the day.\n  4. EDS storage process reads data from landing data store and loads it into the EDS schema (Upsert nature).\n  5. After COB completion, EDS data extraction process creates and deposits the CSV files in a shared file store.\n\n\n## Technical Architecture\nThe following figure shows the technical architecture of EDS.\n![EDS Technical Architecture](https://docs.temenos.com/docs/Solutions/Analytics/Data_Lake_for_Transact/Extract_Data_Store/Resources/Images/Extract%20Data%20Store/Technical_architecture.2.png)\n  1.
